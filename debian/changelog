autopilot-gtk (1.3daily13.06.05-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ Alberto Mardegan ]
  * Export the ATK objects hierarchy as well AtkObject interfaces are
    meant for accessibility, and expose more information which can be
    useful for automated testing. For instance, it is possible to
    enumerate and introspect all the cells in a GtkTreeView. This patch
    exposes the ATK objects hierarchies as children of the root node;
    the existing GtkWidget hierarchy is left untouched, and can still be
    used. . (LP: #1160827)

    added to verify the queries that were otherwise failing with a void
    return set.
